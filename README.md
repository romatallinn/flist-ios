Flist is my personal open-source project. It is intended to help you in keeping all your social contacts at one place so you can easily share them at once with people you meet. The platform allows you to create a profile, which you then fill with the list of any contacts that you want to share; from large social networks such as Facebook, to emails and phone numbers, and to your profiles at small thematic forums. In short, you create your own profile in the online contact book.

### Project

This specific repository is dedicated to the IOS application of Flist. The app is written in Swift, using various third-party libraries.

### TODO
   - **Refactoring**: implement further abstractions for more maintanable code.
   - **QR Generator**: generate custom looking QR codes that link to the profile page.
   - **Dynamic Links**: integrate Firebase's dynamic links that would lead directly to the in-app profile page.
